        Hi, I’m Margery. I’m a software engineer with the passion for both front-end 
        and full stack development. I recently graduated from Seattle University with a 
        bachelor's in computer science and a minor in creative writing. I’m passionate 
        about actualizing creative visions, whether they are a client’s or my own. I also 
        love solving unique problems in ways that put the user’s needs and desires first.  
    </p2>

        Most days I work on finishing my nanodegree in artificial intelligence. For my most 
        recent project, I built an adversarial game-playing agent for the game Isolation 
        and wrote my own heuristic to improve the accuracy of the agent. I also try to 
        find time to upload changes to my websites. Sometimes I’ll practice coding problems 
        on HackerRank or on my own.
    </p2>

        In my free time, I dabble in a little bit of everything. Sometimes I’m chasing the 
        best drama or trash comedy show on Netflix. Sometimes I’m pouring acrylic paint 
        onto thick sheets of Bristol board and swirling the paint around into unique patterns. 
        More recently I’ve been playing through old Xbox and Wii games I never got to play 
        when I was young and finishing old Gameboy and DS Pokémon games I never beat. On 
        weekends, I play online board games with one group of friends and play D&D with 
        another. Late at night you’ll often find me on my phone, writing my next unpublished 
        romance fantasy novel that may never see the light of day.
