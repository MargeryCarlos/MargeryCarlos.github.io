    <h1>Skills</h1>

    <p2>
        I'm really passionate about front end development, but am always down for
        doing back end or full-stack. I'm versatile and willing to try anything!
    </p2>
    <p2>Programming Languages</p2>
    <p2>
        I'm proficient in Python. (It's my favorite language so far.) I'm pretty rusty with C++, 
        but I'm refreshing my brain during quarantine. I'm currently brushing up on my basic HTML, 
        CSS, and Javascript skills with this website. I also have minor experience coding with 
        SQL, C#, OpenGL, and MATLAB. I'm willing to learn or relearn any new programming language 
        life throws at me!
    </p2>
    <p2>Tech Stack</p2>
    <p2>
        I usually code using Visual Studio with Git/GitHub or IDLE. Sometimes I use Notepad or Code::Blocks 
        if I'm feeling overwhelmed. I've worked with Spyder, Git Bash, Emacs in Linux, ASP .NET, and Azure. I'm 
        proficient in using Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, much like other Gen Zers. I currently use a 
        Surface Book with Windows 10. 
    </p2>
    <p2>Languages</p2>
    <p2>
        I was raised speaking sarcasm and English. I earned a minor in creative writing, so I assume my 
        English writing skills are pretty good. I learned some Spanish in school, but it's probably 
        rustier than my C++ skills. (I could probably survive being dropped into a Spanish-speaking country 
        if I needed to.) I also took a class in ASL (American Sign Language) in high school. I can keep a basic 
        conversation going with someone else in ASL and know a bit about the Deaf community.
