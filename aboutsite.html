  <h3>Mission Statement:</h3>
  <p>The mission of this website is to be educational but mostly entertaining and fun. Uncommon Creatures seeks 
	to inform and educate about creatures or animals that may or may not exist. We hope to be a fun site for young people 
	to visit and click around and have a good time reading fun facts about these mystical, elusive creatures. Enjoy your 
	time here and remember to click on pictures that look especially mysterious!
  <h3>What is this site?</h3>
  <p>This is Margery Carlos' website, designed for the CPSC 3700 Web Design class.
	This website will explore the critters and creatures of the 
	Pacific Northwest that may or may not exist. It will have information about 
	these possibly nonexistent creatures, such as where they live, how much they 
	weigh, what they eat, and other miscellaneous facts. </p>
