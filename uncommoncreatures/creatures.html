  <h3>Sasquatch</h3>
  <div class="left">
	<img alt="Blurry Sasquatch in the Woods, Looking at Camera" src="images/bigfoot_evidence.png">
	<p>Sasquatch, also commonly known as Bigfoot, is a very tall, hairy or mostly hairy, muscular, bipedal, 
	ape-like beast that roams forests and other wilderness. Bigfeet often leave footprints in the areas they dwell in, but 
	are rarely ever seen by human eyes. Despite their enormous size compared to humans, they are very good at hiding. Their 
	footprints are claimed to be as big as 24 inches long. They are roughly 6 to 10 feet (2 to 3 meters) tall. Their hair is 
	usually black, dark brown, or dark reddish in color. The Yeti or the Abominable Snowman is the distant cousin of Sasquatch 
	that lives in colder, snowier areas of the world, such as the Alps.

	<img alt="Tree Octopus on a Pine Tree" src="images/tree_octopus.png">
	<p>The Pacific Northwest tree octopus is an amphibious species of octopus that lives in and around trees 
	of the temperate rainforests of the Olympic Peninsula. They are very intelligent and inquisitive creatures. Their skin 
	can change to red or to white from its normal mottled brown to indicate different emotions to one another. They have 
	eight arms, using them to swing from one branch to the next or to cling to the branches they are perched upon. You can 
	find even more information about them <a href="https://zapatopi.net/treeoctopus/">here</a> at The Pacific Northwest Octopus website. 
	</p>

  <h3>Beavers</h3>
  <div class="left">
	<img alt="Sketch of Beaver on a Log" src="images/beaver_sketch.png">
	<p>A beaver is a large, elusive rodent with orange buck teeth and big flat tails. They can gnaw through wood 
	with their strong teeth. They live mainly in ponds, lakes, rivers, marshes, streams, and other wetland areas. They modify 
	their environment and create new habitats by making dams out of sticks, logs, branches, and mud. They are mainly nocturnal 
	and also are very social creatures. 
	<br/>(Editors Note: This is one cryptid I am not sure that I fully believe in. Living in the "Beaver State" of Oregon near a town 
	called Beaverton for 18 full years, I have never seen one single beaver.)
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Weight:</b> 35-65 pounds (16-30 kilograms)

  <h3>The St. Helens Dragon</h3>
  <div class="right">
	<img alt="Mount St. Helens Up Close" src="images/st_helens.jpg" id="helens">
	<p>The St. Helens Dragon lives in a hollow space within Mount St. Helens in Washington. It is the only one 
	of its kind, born and isolated underneath the mountain. The dragon has green scales, two small wings on its back, and 
	moves on all fours. Now, it is about the height of the fictional Godzilla. As the dragon grows, it heats up and eats 
	the surrounding rock. This eating and the dragon's breathing cause lava and ash to erupt out of Mount St. Helens. After, 
	the dragon usually hibernates for twenty-five years before waking up to eat again. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Weight:</b> 91,250 U.S. tons or 182,500,000 pounds (82,781 metric tons or 82,780,608 kilograms)		
		<br><b>What it eats:</b> Lava rock
		<br><b>Fun fact:</b> Despite its wings, the St. Helens Dragon cannot fly but will eventually grow to

  <div class="left">
	<img alt="Willatuk Popping Head Out of Puget Sound" src="images/willatuk.jpg" id="willa">
	<p>Willatuk the Sea Serpent is Seattle's own Loch Ness monster. It is a dinosaur-like sea creature that 
	lives in the Puget Sound, Lake Union, and Lake Washington around the city of Seattle. It has a long neck and large 
	flippers it uses to navigate the deep, fast waters of the Puget Sound. Like Nessie, modern man wants to study it and 
	hunt it down, but it prefers to stay unseen and safely mysterious. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Weight:</b> Irrelevant due to buoyancy in water
		<br><b>What it eats:</b> Salmon, trout, eels, and other fish and aquatic life in the sound

	<p>Squirrats live on city college campuses in Seattle with many trees and shrubbery. They are similar to werewolves in 
	how they transform into another being. During the day, these creatures live out their lives as squirrels. However, 
	during the night, they become rats. They are mainly seen on college campuses, scurrying around busy and tired feet.
