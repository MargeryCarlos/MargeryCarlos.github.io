# Welcome to Uncommon Creatures!

Welcome to my GitHub website repository's uncommoncreature folder. This directory holds all the pages and files for my Uncommon Creatures website. 

## What is Uncommon Creatures?

Uncommon Creatures of the Pacific Northwest is a simple site I first created from scratch in my Art of Web Design class at Seattle University. It is a (mock) site dedicated to spreading information about cryptids of the Pacific Northwest that may or may not exist. The website is a way for me to showcase my HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills as I learn and improve them. 

## Where can I see the website?

You can visit the site by going [here](https://margerycarlos.github.io/uncommoncreatures/ucpnw_index.html). 

## How can I use this repo?

If you would like to, you may clone this repository via GitHub and create a site similar to mine. I got the site up and running on the web using GitHub Pages. You can find a tutorial for GitHub Pages [here](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/#setup).

Some of the cartoony images and logos are personally drawn by me, some were found from open sources like Unsplash. I highly suggest using your own images and themes to build your own site. However, if you want to find usable, copyright-free images from other sources, I suggest poking around for open source photos online.

Feel free to let me know if you find any issues with the site whilst viewing or cloning! It is still being worked on and improved.
