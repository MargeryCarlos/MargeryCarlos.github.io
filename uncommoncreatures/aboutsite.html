  <h3>Mission Statement:</h3>
  <p>The mission of this website is to be educational but mostly entertaining and fun. Uncommon Creatures seeks 
	to inform and educate about creatures or animals that may or may not exist. We hope to be a fun site for young people 
	to visit and click around and have a good time reading fun facts about these mystical, elusive creatures. Enjoy your 
	time here and remember to click on pictures that look especially mysterious!
  <h3>What is this site?</h3>
  <p>This is Margery Carlos' website, originally designed for the CPSC 3700 Web Design class at Seattle University.
	  Its current purpose is to showcase some of Margery's HTML, CSS, and UI design skills.
	This website explores the critters and creatures of the 
	Pacific Northwest that may or may not exist. It has information about 
	these possibly nonexistent creatures, such as where they live, how much they 
	weigh, what they eat, and other miscellaneous facts. </p>
