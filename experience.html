            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>Seattle University</p>
            <p>
                I graduated in June 2020 from <a href="https://www.seattleu.edu/">Seattle University</a>
                with a bachelor's in Computer Science and a minor in Creative Writing.
            </p>

            <p>Central Catholic High School</p>
            <p>
                I went to <a href="https://www.centralcatholichigh.org/"> high school</a> 
                in Portland, Oregon right across the street from a
                cemetery. I started in 2012 and graduated in 2016.

            <p>Udacity AI Nanodegree</p>
            <p>
                I am currently enrolled in a nanodegree program online with Udacity.
                I am learning more about artificial intelligence and working on four major
                <a href="https://github.com/MargeryCarlos">projects</a>.

            <h2>Software</h2>
            <p>Senior Capstone Project</p>
            <p>
                In my senior year at Seattle University, I worked on a student team with
                SDI Engineering to implement an authorization and authentication system
                as well as telemetry system into their landing gear simulation software,
                GearSim. We used Oauth and Microsoft Azure technologies to integrate the
                systems into their MATLAB and Simulink based software. I loved focusing on
                the needs of the clients and creating something they were satisfied with.
            </p>
            <p>Video Game Project</p>
            <p>
                With two other students I created the prototype of a 2D platformer game
                using OpenGL and C++. I mainly focused on implementing visuals, story,
                and sound while the other students worked mainly on physics and controls.
                The game followed two playable sibling characters in an apocalyptic
                ghostly world as they tried to get back home to their village. It was
                super fun to work on and I hope I can do more projects like this in the
                future!
            </p>
            <p>Web Design Projects</p>
            <p>
                In my Web Design Class junior year, I created two websites from scratch
                using basic HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. The cryptid website I created
                by myself and is now being hosted in <a href="https://margerycarlos.github.io/uncommoncreatures">this very domain</a> 
                as I took time to reboot it during quarantine. The other website I created 
                with two other classmates. It focused on spreading information about the 
                botanical categories of what we call vegetables and fruits. For both 
                websites, I focused on UX design and making everything as accessible as 
                possible.
            </p>
            <p>AI Nanodegree Projects</p>
            <p>
                During quarantine I decided to enroll in an AI nanodegree program online. 
                I worked on four major projects using Python: a sudoku solver, a game 
                playing agent, a classical planning agent, and a speech tagger. I have 
                <a href="https://github.com/MargeryCarlos?tab=repositories">uploaded them all to GitHub</a> 
                if you would like to know more about them.

            <h2>Work</h2>
            <p>Black Butte Ranch</p>
            <p>
                In the summer of 2019, I worked in a golf pro shop at Black Butte Ranch in Sisters,
                Oregon. I worked with a POS system to handle transactions and booked tee times and
                kept the shop tidy and clean. I went in knowing nothing about golf. I came out knowing
                a lot more about people (and a little about golf).
            </p>
            <p>Costco</p>
            <p>
                In 2017, I worked at Costco during the summer in Beaverton, Oregon. I worked mainly 
                in the food court but sometimes on the front end boxing groceries. I learned how 
                to work well with coworkers I didn't always agree with. I think everyone should work 
                in retail or food service at least once.
