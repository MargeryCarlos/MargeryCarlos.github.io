            <p>Education</p>
            <p2>Seattle University</p2>
            <p2>
                I graduated in June 2020 from <a href="https://www.seattleu.edu/">Seattle University</a>
                with a bachelor's in Computer Science and a minor in Creative Writing.

            <p2>Central Catholic High School</p2>
            <p2>
                I went to <a href="https://www.centralcatholichigh.org/"> high school</a> in Portland, Oregon right across the street from a
                cemetery. I started in 2012 and graduated in 2016.

            <p2>Udacity AI Nanodegree</p2>
            <p2>
                I am currently enrolled in a nanodegree program online with Udacity.
                I am learning more about artificial intelligence and working on four major

            <p>Work</p>
            <p2>Black Butte Ranch</p2>
            <p2>
                In the summer of 2019, I worked in a golf pro shop at Black Butte Ranch in Sisters,
                Oregon. I worked with a POS system to handle transactions and booked tee times and
                kept the shop tidy and clean. I went in knowing nothing about golf. I came out knowing
                a lot more about people (and a little about golf).
            </p2>
            <p2>Costco</p2>
            <p2>
                In 2017, I worked at Costco during the summer in Beaverton, Oregon. I worked mainly 
                in the food court but sometimes on the front end boxing groceries. I learned how 
                to work well with coworkers I didn't always agree with. I think everyone should work 
                in retail or food service at least once.
